# Moon-Rock-Samples
Data science project that gives the amount and type of rock samples that must be brought back by future moon explorations.
<h2>Where is the data from?</h2>
  <p>The data is collected from the official NASA website. The rock sample information is an open source file availabe on the NASA.gov site.</p>
<h2>What are the modules used?</h2>
  <p>Pandas is the only module used in this project. No machine learning algorithms were required in the prediction of the rock samples.</p>
<h3>Working of the project</h3>
<p>The moon rock sample dataframe has the information on the types and the amount of rock samples collected by the six apollo missions. We also have information available on type of rock samples that have been used the most for research by geologist and the amount of rock samples that remain. We use the pandas module to analyse the amount and the type of rock samples that must be brought back for research by future mission on moon. At the end of this project we provide a simple and compact dataframe for the astronauts to refer while collecting the rock samples</p>
